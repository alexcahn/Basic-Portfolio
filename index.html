        <p>
            My name is Alex Cahn and I am originally from Irvine, California. I graduated from California State
            University,
            Chico with a degree in Marketing and a minor in Sales. After college, I got my first job ever at a company
            called Glassdoor. At Glassdoor, I watched the company grow from 80 employees to 1,000 worldwide and
            eventually
            moved to Chicago to help start their office. A few years later, I wanted to be back at a startup and
            currently
            work at G2 Crowd. This Bootcamp is exciting to me because it's going to help me boost my current skillset as
            well as help me figure out which career course I'd like to take.

            People always ask me, "why the hell would you move to Chicago from California?" Well, the truth is, I'm
            hoping
            to make my way back there at some point in my life. For now, the beer and food in this city is too damn
            good!
